The task at hand is to build an interactive form that allows modifications to a character's attributes, leveraging the Star Wars API for data gathering and storing these in a state.
Here is a refined breakdown of the project:

Project Aim:
The main objective is to design a mutable form for updating the information of characters. You will obtain the characters' details from the Star Wars API
(https://swapi.dev/) and keep them in the state.

Preliminary Steps:

1. Kick off your project using an appropriate MV framework like Angular, Svelte, Vue, or React. A bonus point is earned if you use TypeScript (TS). Select and install a design system or a bootstrap library make sure the library supports TypeScript if you have decided to use TS.

2. Think about state management and which type to use (local hook state, React:redux, recoil, Vue: Pinia, or other alternatives ).

Advice:
● Try not to depend excessively on external libraries when you can achieve the same functionality with a basic function/method.
● If a feature isn't blocking other aspects, proceed to the next task and revisit it later. Progress is key, and you don't want to be held back by a single issue.
● Feel free to reach out for help from your supervisor (MN) if you find yourself facing any difficulties or uncertainties

Specifications:

1. Follow the design on Figma
   (https://www.figma.com/file/fM2lJL7SH2XEi9wFEXVvbZ/Star-Wars---Demo-Site-(Nu%C4%8Di%C4%8D)?type=design&node-id=1-2&t=JqDxSzrrh2U12aRx-0).
2. Deploy a data-fetching library like Axios, or use native fetch() to retrieve asynchronous data.
3. Understand how the Star Wars API returns a person and devise a way to load all characters, or a select few, into the state. 
   If this proves too challenging, create a list of characters and mock the API call using Promises and setTimeout.
4. The entire operation should be confined to a single screen. The flow includes:
   ● User navigates to localhost:3000 url.
   ● The application determines whether the user possesses any state for Star Wars characters.
   ● If the state exists, display the list; otherwise, show a loader while fetching data from the API.
   ● Once the list is ready, the user can amend the details of any character by opening an editable form.
   ● The form should contain a "Save" button, which modifies the character's data, and a "Cancel" button, which removes the form.
   ● After pressing "Save," the modified details of the character are saved to the state.

Extra Credit:
● Make the page mobile responsive. Think about the menu and how it will be handled on mobile devices and how to position the data so it will take less scrolling for a user to get to the information he wants to read.
● Maintain a persistent state by saving API data to local storage. Before initiating an API call, verify if the user data resides in the state or local storage. Also, keep the state and local storage data synchronized.

What we want to see:
● The code should be efficient and free of any performance issues.
● User-friendly features include loaders during actions and notifications or hints in case of errors.
● Maintain a clear and straightforward folder structure.
● The code should be well-structured and easily understandable.
● Extensive commentary to explain code functionality.
● Try to cut time by using libraries, but do not overuse them.
● Try to develop a helper–hooks library of your own.
● Rectification of all console errors and warnings.

Unacceptable Practices:
● Unclear, sloppy code.
● Inefficient folder arrangement
● Undocumented code.
● Too many external libraries to save the day.
● Unhandled errors showing in the browser or console.

Remember the goal of this assignment is to see how well you get around new and challenging tasks. It is okay to be stuck at a problem for some time, but if that problem will take too much of your time, then move on and complete other tasks. It is okay to leave this task partially finished, but it is not okay to leave it unfinished and broken. Good luck and let the force be with you!
